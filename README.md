# fuzzypareo

## Overview

fuzzypareo is an R package that provides tools to match two databases based on names in Spanish and dates of birth. It leverages the fact that
in spanish we use two last names, paternal and maternal. 
It attempts to correct spelling errors and data entry errors such as both last names in the first last name column.
